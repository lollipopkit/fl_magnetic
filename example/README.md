# Example (macOS supported)

This is a minimal Flutter app showcasing `MagneticView`.

macOS platform files are already generated in `example/macos/`.

Run on macOS:

```sh
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run -d macos
```

You can also run on other platforms by adding them later with:

```sh
flutter create . --platforms=ios,android,web,windows,linux
```
